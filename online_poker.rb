# Bonus
# 1. This assumes shuffled_deck contains all 52 cards. What if we can't trust this (e.g. some cards are being secretly removed by the shuffle)?
# 2. This assumes each number in shuffled_deck is unique. How can we adapt this to rifling arrays of random integers with potential repeats?
# 3. Our solution returns true if you just cut the deckâ€”take one half and put it on top of the other. While that technically meets the definition of a riffle, what if you wanted to ensure that some mixing of the two halves occurred?
